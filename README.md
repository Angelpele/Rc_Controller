# Arduino-based Remote Controller üéÆ

This project consists on an Arduino-based remote controller using an **NRF24L01** radio communication module, **Arduino Uno**, a **16x2 LCD screen**, **two joysticks** for directional control, and an **LED** indicator for status. It is designed to control a compatible device (like an RC car or robot) wirelessly.

## Version 1 

- **Arduino Uno**: The central microcontroller to process input signals and manage communication.
- **NRF24L01 Module**: A wireless transceiver module used for communication between the remote controller and the target device.
- **16x2 LCD Screen**: Provides real-time feedback to the user (e.g., connection status or joystick values).
- **Two Joysticks**: Used for controlling the movement of the target device on both X and Y axes.
- **LED Indicator**: A visual cue to show the connection status of the remote controller.

The enclosure was 3d printed in PLA and a methacrylate protector was installed. The ergonomy of the controller was not the best as the joysticks were turned 45¬∫.

## Version 2 - (Updates) üõ†Ô∏è

| Feature              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Battery Power**     | Allows for portability without needing a wired connection. |
| **New Enclosure**     | A custom-designed case to protect the electronics and improve the overall look. |
| **Power Switch**      | An easy-to-use power switch for turning the device on and off. |
| **Improved Grip**     | A better ergonomic design for comfortable handling during use. |
| **Aesthetic Enhancements** | A visually appealing design to make the controller look more attractive. |
